            <p>I’ve been thinking about you, and I just want to say I’m really, genuinely sorry.</p>

            <p>When you were trying to open up to me, I pulled away instead of leaning in and I know that must have hurt. I hate that I made you feel dismissed or disrespected when all you were doing was being honest with me.</p>

            <p>Even if I was trying not to react badly, checking out still made you feel alone in that moment. And I’m really sorry for that. You didn’t deserve it.</p>

            <p>I understand why you felt disappointed, especially because this isn’t the first time. I never want to be someone who makes you feel like your feelings aren’t safe with me. You matter to me so much more than my discomfort in a hard conversation.</p>

            <p>I care about you deeply, and I’m taking this seriously. I’m learning how to stay present and softer when things feel hard, because you’re worth that effort.</p>

            <p>Thank you for being patient with me and for telling me how you felt. I really love and value you.</p>

            <p class="sig"> - always and forever yours</p>
